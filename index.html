                        Although, the romans were the first to design left and right foot shoes. Shoes were originally designed feet from sharp objects, rough terrain, and other 
                        elements that could cause harm. Warmth during the harsh winters were also other purposes of shoes. Over human history, shoes changed with color, design, style, 
                        purposes such as sports, and even for overall health to what we see today.</p>

                        they wore helped disguise their eyes as to not be read before final judgement was made. Modern sunglasses became possible once the manipulation of UV light was discovered.
                        The Inuit people can be credited with the earliest version of sunglasses. In the late 19th century, they used whale bone with thin slits to see through which shielded their

                        mere straps of cloth fastened snug around their chest and held in place using pins in the back. They were used mainly when doing sports or any other strenuous physical
                        activity. Corsets gained massive popularity during medieval times and were made of whale bone to help keep the ridged shape allowing for the cone/hourglass shape under
                        pressure that was desired. With time, both bras and corsets received vast modifications for greater comfort, appeal, and support for women of all bust shape/size.</p>

                    <p>– A simple and iconic name was created by a novelist, F. Scott Fitzgerald. He used this term in his novel
                        “This Side of Paradise” to describe the T shape of the shirt. The creation of this shirt came from meeting 
                        consumers demand for a top to be used during warm weather. Normally people would take a full onesie, cut the
                        top portion off, and tuck in the end of top into their bottoms. The U.S. Navy popularized this garment in 1913
