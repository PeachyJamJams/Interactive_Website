                <p>Earliest proven examples of footwear could be traced back to 7,000-8,000 BC, which were Sagerbrush bark sandals found in the Fort Rock Cave in Oregon, USA. 
                Although, the romans were the first to design left and right foot shoes. Shoes were originally designed feet from sharp objects, rough terrain, and other elements that could cause harm. 
                Warmth during the harsh winters were also other purposes of shoes. Over human history, shoes changed with color, design, style, purposes such as sports, and even for overall health to what we see today.

                <p> Glasses however were in existence since 13th century China and used by judges as to not scrutinize their judgement through facial expressions. 
                    The dark quartz glasses they wore helped disguise their eyes as to not be read before final judgement was made. Modern sunglasses became possible once the manipulation of UV light was discovered. 
                    The Inuit people can be credited with the earliest version of sunglasses. In the late 19th century they used whale bone with thin slits to see through which shielded their eyes from the bright reflection of light coming off of the white snow around them.

                <p>Multibillion dollar companies dedicate themselves to bras/corsets in our modern day but these pieces date back all the way back to women in Greece and Rome. Their bras were mere straps of cloth fastened snug around their chest and held in place using pins in the back. 
                They were used mainly when doing sports or any other strenuous physical activity. Corsets gained massive popularity during medieval times and were made of whale bone to help keep the ridged shape allowing for the cone/hourglass shape under pressure that was desired. 
                With time, both bras and corsets received vast modifications for greater comfort, appeal, and support for women of all bust shape/size.
